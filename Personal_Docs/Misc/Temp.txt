Task_Description, Category, Region_Tag, Status, Assignee, Priority, Due_Date, Completed_On
I also wanted to have a dynamic global search filter for whole data pane along with some Bar chart, line chart and pie chart based analytics for my tasks, I have a csv file to upoload with my dummy daata to start with.

Can you delete all exiting functionality with Load Local button and reimplement as per this algorithm
