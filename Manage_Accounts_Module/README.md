# Simple Manage Accounts - New Implementation

This is a completely new, simple approach to the Manage Accounts functionality that actually works!

## How It Works

Instead of using the complex File System Access API, this solution uses a simple Python file server to serve your files, and a clean HTML interface to display and preview them.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Start the File Server

**Option A: Using the batch file (Recommended)**
1. Double-click `start_server.bat`
2. The server will start and show a message
3. Keep this window open while using Manage Accounts

**Option B: Using Python directly**
1. Open Command Prompt in the Manage_Accounts_Module folder
2. Run: `python file_server.py`
3. Keep this window open while using Manage Accounts

### 2. Use the Interface

1. Go to the main ClearView application
2. Click "Manage Accounts"
3. The interface will load your files automatically
4. Click any file to preview it
5. Use Download/Print buttons as needed

## Features

✅ **Real File Access**: Actually reads your files from the folder
✅ **Real Previews**: Shows actual PDF, image, and text content
✅ **No Folder Picker**: Works directly with your hardcoded folder
✅ **Persistent**: Remembers your folder choice
✅ **Simple**: No complex APIs or permissions needed

## File Types Supported

- **PDF**: Full PDF preview in iframe
- **Images**: JPG, PNG, GIF preview
- **Text**: TXT, MD files with syntax highlighting
- **Others**: Download button for unsupported types

## Troubleshooting

**"Server Not Connected" message:**
- Make sure the Python file server is running
- Check that port 8080 is not blocked
- Try refreshing the page

**Files not loading:**
- Check that the folder path in `file_server.py` is correct
- Make sure the folder exists and has files
- Check the server console for error messages

## Technical Details

- **Server**: Python HTTP server on localhost:8080
- **Interface**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **File Access**: Direct file serving via HTTP
- **No Permissions**: No browser security restrictions

This approach is much simpler and more reliable than the previous File System Access API method!
