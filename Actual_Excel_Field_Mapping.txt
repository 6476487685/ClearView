ACTUAL EXCEL FIELD MAPPING FOR EXPENSE MODULE
================================================================================

YOUR EXCEL COLUMNS → INTERNAL DATA STRUCTURE FIELDS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────

Excel Column              →  Internal Field Name
───────────────────────────────────────────────────
Expance_Description      →  Expense_Description
Category_Expanse         →  Expense_Category
Ac_Tag_Expance          →  Expense_Tag
Txn_Tag                 →  ??? (Need clarification - not mapped yet)
Payment_Mode            →  Expense_Mode
Ac_Holder               →  Expense_Holder
Frequency               →  Expense_Frequency
Amount                  →  Expense_Amount
Due_Date                →  Expense_Due_Date
Paid_Date               →  Expense_Paid_Date
Paid_From               →  Links to Income_Ac_Tag (cross-reference)
Ac_Status               →  Expense_Account_Status
Txn_Status              →  Expense_Txn_Status

NOTES:
──────

1. "Paid_From" field:
   - This is a cross-reference to Income module
   - It should link to Income_Ac_Tag field from Income sheet
   - This means when an expense is paid, it should reference which income account it was paid from
   - This is a relationship field, not a core expense field

2. "Txn_Tag" field:
   - Not currently mapped
   - Need to clarify what this field represents
   - Possible options:
     a) Remove it from Expense structure
     b) Map it to a separate field
     c) Merge it with Ac_Tag_Expance

3. Currency field missing:
   - Your Excel doesn't have a Currency column
   - Need to handle this:
     a) Add Currency column to Excel
     b) Default to a currency (USD, INR, etc.)
     c) Add it as an additional field in Excel

UPDATED EXCEL UPDATE TOOL MAPPING:
───────────────────────────────────

When updating Excel file, the tool should map:
- Expance_Description → Expense_Description
- Category_Expanse → Expense_Category
- Ac_Tag_Expance → Expense_Tag
- Payment_Mode → Expense_Mode
- Ac_Holder → Expense_Holder
- Frequency → Expense_Frequency
- Amount → Expense_Amount
- Due_Date → Expense_Due_Date
- Paid_Date → Expense_Paid_Date
- Ac_Status → Expense_Account_Status
- Txn_Status → Expense_Txn_Status
- Paid_From → Keep as is (links to Income_Ac_Tag)
- Txn_Tag → Need clarification

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS:
================================================================================

1. Add Currency column to your Expense Excel file
2. Clarify what Txn_Tag field represents
3. Decide if Paid_From should be:
   a) A dropdown in Expense form (showing Income_Ac_Tag values)
   b) A read-only field
   c) A relationship field tracked separately

No its still not correct Why not you count how many records are there in master fields in from Excel file and then ensure how many are puplulating in Add/Edit modal so you know that these are not working correctly, I notice Cussrncy, Txn_Mode, Ac_Status and Txn_Status are still loading dummy data. SO with Add/Edit Modal with each drop down in brackets mention the number of itesm in list as well, beacuse you implemented the chnage globally you have messased up Task Dashboards also earlier its Add/Edit modal working fine now it also started showing statange begavious. To implement this FIrst of in Manager Masters Dashboards create 4 sections for  Income, Investment, Expase and Task master filelda and addtional section for common Master filed used across all or some of these sheeets. FOr each filed mention in brackets what you have read from Excel at first load keep it persistant untill next relaod of master Excel file.
