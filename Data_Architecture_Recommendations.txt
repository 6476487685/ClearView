Now this version of Manage Task Dashboard is working perfectly with my actual Excel file, reading, writing, making changes to my existing data, filters matching with my data fields, and data loading in data pane added, it also works. So now the same kind of functionality has to be implemented with my investment, income, and expense files also, and all their data is also coming from the same Excel file. You need not to implement right now anything, we will be doing one by one together later, but please suggest what is the best way that if I just put this file at one place, like the load local data functionality, from there it should load everywhere required fields to corresponding expense, investment, income, and task files, their master records, their master data, and their transactional data also in the data panes, so that one file populates everywhere, and we also have to also incorporate one thing called manage master data, where all these master data fields from this Excel file can be modified, or added, or deleted. So what is the best way to implement that? Just suggest me, do not implement anything right now.


================================================================================
CENTRALIZED DATA ARCHITECTURE RECOMMENDATIONS
ClearView Dashboard - Multi-Module Data Management
================================================================================

PROBLEM STATEMENT
-----------------
- Currently: Each module (Task, Investment, Income, Expense) loads its own Excel file
- Needed: Single Excel file should populate ALL modules with their respective data
- Needed: Centralized "Manage Master Data" interface to edit all master data
- Challenge: All modules need access to master data and transactional data from one file


RECOMMENDED SOLUTION
================================================================================

1. CENTRALIZED DATA LOADER UTILITY
-----------------------------------
   Create: Data_Loader.js (shared utility)

   Responsibilities:
   - Read multi-sheet Excel file (Master_Data.xlsx)
   - Parse all master data sheets
   - Parse all transactional sheets
   - Distribute data to module-specific localStorage

   localStorage Structure:
   ├── task_records (array)
   ├── task_master_data { Category_Task, Task_Tag, Task_Status, Task_Assignee, Task_Priority, Task_Adhoc }
   ├── investment_records (array)
   ├── investment_master_data { Investment_Type, Investment_Category, etc. }
   ├── income_records (array)
   ├── income_master_data { Income_Source, Income_Category, etc. }
   ├── expense_records (array)
   └── expense_master_data { Expense_Category, Expense_Payment_Method, etc. }


2. ENHANCED MAIN DASHBOARD
---------------------------
   File: index.html

   Changes:
   - Add "Load Data File" button (uploads Master_Data.xlsx)
   - Uses Data_Loader.js to parse and distribute data
   - Calls loadDataIntoModules() function
   - Shows success message with number of records loaded
   - Refreshes all open dashboards (if using iframes/tabs)

   Flow:
   User clicks "Load Data File" → Selects Master_Data.xlsx → 
   Data_Loader.js processes → Data distributed to localStorage → 
   Success message shown


3. MANAGE MASTER DATA INTERFACE
---------------------------------
   Create: Manage_Master_Data.html

   Features:
   - Tabbed interface (Task, Investment, Income, Expense)
   - Each tab shows all master data fields for that module
   - CRUD operations: Add, Edit, Delete master data items
   - Real-time updates to localStorage (task_master_data, investment_master_data, etc.)
   - Export button to save all master data back to Excel
   - Auto-refresh dropdowns in dashboards after changes

   Example for Task Master Data:
   - Category_Task dropdown/list with Add/Edit/Delete buttons
   - Task_Tag dropdown/list with Add/Edit/Delete buttons
   - Task_Status dropdown/list with Add/Edit/Delete buttons
   - Task_Assignee dropdown/list with Add/Edit/Delete buttons
   - Task_Priority dropdown/list with Add/Edit/Delete buttons
   - Task_Adhoc (Snippets) dropdown/list with Add/Edit/Delete buttons


4. DATA SYNCHRONIZATION
------------------------
   Module Dashboards (Task, Investment, Income, Expense):

   When Master Data Changes:
   - Detect localStorage changes in each dashboard
   - Auto-refresh dropdown/filter values
   - Update UI without full page reload

   When Transactional Data Changes:
   - Each module manages its own transactional records
   - Task module edits → saved to task_records
   - Investment module edits → saved to investment_records
   - Income module edits → saved to income_records
   - Expense module edits → saved to expense_records


5. RECOMMENDED EXCEL FILE STRUCTURE
------------------------------------
   File: Master_Data.xlsx

   Master Data Sheets:
   ├── Category_Task
   ├── Task_Tag
   ├── Task_Status
   ├── Task_Assignee
   ├── Task_Priority
   ├── Task_Adhoc
   ├── Investment_Type
   ├── Investment_Category
   ├── Income_Source
   ├── Income_Category
   ├── Expense_Category
   └── Expense_Payment_Method

   Transactional Data Sheets:
   ├── Txn_Task
   ├── Txn_Investment
   ├── Txn_Income
   └── Txn_Expense

   Master Sheet Format:
   - Sheet name matches field name (e.g., "Category_Task")
   - Single column with header matching sheet name
   - Each row is a master data value

   Transactional Sheet Format:
   - Sheet name: "Txn_Task", "Txn_Investment", etc.
   - Multiple columns matching module's fields
   - Each row is a transactional record


6. IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE
---------------------------
   Phase 1: Data Loader (Data_Loader.js)
   - Create centralized Excel parser
   - Function: loadDataFromExcel(file)
   - Function: distributeToModules()
   - Test with Master_Data.xlsx

   Phase 2: Main Dashboard Integration
   - Update index.html with upload button
   - Wire to Data_Loader.js
   - Implement success/error handling

   Phase 3: Module Synchronization
   - Update Task dashboard to use shared structure
   - Update Investment dashboard to use shared structure
   - Update Income dashboard to use shared structure
   - Update Expense dashboard to use shared structure
   - Each module loads on page load from localStorage
   - Each module updates its own section when changes are made

   Phase 4: Manage Master Data Interface
   - Create Manage_Master_Data.html
   - Implement CRUD operations for each master data type
   - Add export functionality
   - Connect to localStorage for real-time updates

   Phase 5: Export Functionality
   - Each module exports its transactional data + master data
   - Consolidate exports from all modules to update Master_Data.xlsx


7. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
--------------------------
   File Structure:
   ClearView/
   ├── index.html (Main Dashboard)
   ├── Data_Loader.js (Centralized Loader)
   ├── Manage_Master_Data.html (Master Data Editor)
   ├── 5_Task.html
   ├── 5_Task_Main.js
   ├── 5_Task_Style.css
   ├── [Investment files]
   ├── [Income files]
   └── [Expense files]

   Data Flow:
   1. User uploads Master_Data.xlsx on index.html
   2. Data_Loader.js reads and parses all sheets
   3. Data distributed to localStorage (task_master_data, task_records, etc.)
   4. User opens Task dashboard → reads from localStorage
   5. User edits task → saves to task_records
   6. User opens Manage Master Data → edits Category_Task
   7. Save → updates task_master_data in localStorage
   8. Task dashboard dropdowns auto-refresh
   9. User exports Task data → downloads updated Excel


8. ADVANTAGES OF THIS APPROACH
--------------------------------
   ✅ Single source of truth (one Excel file)
   ✅ Centralized master data management
   ✅ Clean separation between master and transactional data
   ✅ Easy to add new modules (reuse Data_Loader.js)
   ✅ Scalable architecture
   ✅ All data persists in localStorage
   ✅ Consistent data structure across modules


9. ALTERNATIVE CONSIDERATIONS
------------------------------
   Option A: Database (SQLite via sql.js)
   - Pros: More robust, better queries, relationships
   - Cons: More complex, requires learning SQL

   Option B: Continue current approach
   - Pros: Simple, already working
   - Cons: No centralization, duplicate master data

   Recommendation: Proceed with centralized localStorage approach (simpler, 
   already proven to work with Task module, easier to implement)


10. KEY IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
----------------------------
    - Use SheetJS (already included) for Excel parsing
    - Maintain backward compatibility with existing modules
    - Keep module-specific logic separate
    - Use event listeners to detect localStorage changes
    - Implement fallback mechanisms if Master_Data.xlsx not loaded
    - Add validation for sheet names and column structures
    - Provide user feedback at each step (loading, success, error)


================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Create Data_Loader.js with Excel parsing logic
2. Update index.html with upload functionality
3. Test Task dashboard with centralized data loading
4. Implement Manage Master Data interface
5. Extend to other modules (Investment, Income, Expense)
6. Add export functionality to consolidate all changes back to Excel
